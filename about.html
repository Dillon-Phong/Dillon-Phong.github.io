<p>I'm a computer science major at Hunter College, and my graduation date is projected to be in 2023. I have a background in Python, C++, C#, and Java development, and have experimented with game design using Unity and Unreal Engine as well as web design using HTML, CSS, and Markdown. My guilty pleasure is playing around with image manipulation using GIMP and creating wacky edits to get a laugh out of people. Having said that, the field of Cyber is where my genuine passion lies.</p>

<p>I’m fascinated by the cyber security dangers our planet confronts on a daily basis and find amusement in analyzing how a cyberattack unfolds, compiling data from several sources into a single, well-organized report to ascertain the actions that take place during a beach. You could say I take satisfaction in transforming the tumultuous aftermath of a cyberattack into something that is clear, straightforward and easy to understand. I also find enjoyment in putting myself in the mind of a hacker and hypothesizing how the smallest change in attack strategy could affect the outcome, either disrupting the cyberattack, or maximizing its damage.</p>
