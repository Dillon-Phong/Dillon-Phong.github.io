    - Rackspace’s hosted Microsoft Exchange service began to experience problems.

<h1>Facts/Damages:</h1>

- After Rackspace issued an [update statement on Twitter](https://twitter.com/Rackspace/status/1598761923008266240?s=20) on Friday, that didn’t provide clients with any additional information. Users in the replies were quick to rip the company apart.
    > @Rare_Elements - [*“This is a pathetic response @Rackspace. We are NOT patient, you are not posting regular updates…….and it’s coming up on 14 hours of downtime. Don’t you have redundancy in place???”*](https://twitter.com/Rare_Elements/status/1598762514820476928?s=20)
