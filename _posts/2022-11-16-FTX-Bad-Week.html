            <li>CoinDesk publishes an article showing that Alameda Research is heavily invested in the FTX
                exchange&#39;s FTT token. </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>November 6, 2022 (Sunday)<ul>
            <li>The CEO of Binance, FTX&#39;s largest competitor, Changpeng Zhao, announces that he&#39;s selling his
                remaining FTT tokens.</li>
            <li>Minutes later, Caroline Ellison, CEO of Alameda Research, tweets that Alameda will buy Zhao&#39;s FTT
                tokens for $22 each.</li>
            <li>Zhao&#39;s announcement causes the price of FTT to plummet, as users begin selling their tokens in
                panic, prompting FTX to withdraw $6 billion sometime in the next 72 hours, money they did not have on
                hand. </li>

    <li>Alameda played a key role in FTX&#39;s meltdown - which began after CoinDesk reported that the hedge fund was
        heavily invested in FTT, a token issued by FTX. The disclosure prompted rival Binance to dump its FTT holdings
        and sparked a liquidity crunch that toppled FTX Group within days. (<a

    <li>Investigators at the S.E.C. and the Justice Department are examining whether Bankman-Fried improperly used
        customer funds to prop up Alameda Research, a trading firm that he also owns.</li>
    <li>FTX funneled $10 billion in client funds to Alameda to help bolster the firm&#39;s risky bets, and at least $1
        billion of those funds is reportedly unaccounted for even amongst Alameda&#39;s assets.</li>
    <li>There was a backdoor into the accounting/book-keeping spreadsheets that allowed Sam Bankman-Fried to make
        changes to FTX&#39;s financials without alerting other systems.</li>
    <li>FTX has to pay over 1 million creditors, the theft of funds from the hack is compounding this difficulty.</li>

<h2 id="opinion-">Opinion:</h2>
<p>It was near impossible trying to find info regarding the specifics of the breach and malware. Almost all articles on
    the situation focus on the financial and business aspects, with minimal information on the cyber side. With the
    prevalence of shady business dealings and mismanagement going on at FTX, I personally believe the hack to be an
    inside job. Both FTX and FTX U.S. were breached simultaneously, just hours after they announced they were filing for
    bankruptcy. Such quick exfiltration means the hacker(s) had to have been in both FTX and FTX U.S.&#39;s systems
    before news of FTX&#39;s collapse even became mainstream or that they had a backdoor into the system. There&#39;s
    online speculation that Sam Bankman-Fried orchestrated the hack himself to try and take the money and run. It&#39;s
    clear why people believe this. Bankman-Fried&#39;s backdoor into FTX&#39;s financial spreadsheets is one of the most
    suspicious things I have ever seen in a company.</p>
<p>Furthermore, FTX and Alameda are two distinct legal entities owned by Sam Bankman-Fried, but with how closely they
    operate, they may as well be the same. Allegedly, both companies were managed by Bankman-Fried&#39;s inner circle of
    10 roommates. All of them either are or have been in romantic relationships with one another, with Sam
    Bankman-Fried, CEO of FTX, once dating Alameda&#39;s CEO, Caroline Ellison. Ellison also has a viral tweet stating
    <em>&#39;nothing like regular amphetamine use to make you appreciate how dumb a lot of normal, non-medicated human
        experience is&#39;</em> which led the New York Post to do some digging where they found a <a
        href="https://www.listennotes.com/podcasts/the-feedback-loop/sam-and-the-art-of-effective-DOU3SJaK2ZM/">podcast
        interview</a> with Bankman-Fried from October 2020, where he admitted to experimenting with Adderall and other
    amphetamines, which doesn&#39;t look good when people find out you secretly funneled $10 billion in client funds
    from one company to another, somehow losing $1 billion in the process, and then getting an additional half a billion
    dollars stolen. There will definitely be a lengthy legal investigation by U.S. officials into FTX&#39;s financial
    collapse and missing funds in the near future.</p>

<p>As of noon today, Sam Bankman-Fried and several celebrity promoters are now being sued by investors. The lawsuit
    filed last night alleges that FTX yield-bearing accounts were unregistered securities that were unlawfully sold in
    the U.S.. The issuer of the suit, Edwin Garrison, claims that FTX lured U.S. investors to its yield-bearing
    accounts, it was a &quot;Ponzi scheme&quot; where investor funds were shuffled to related entities to maintain the
    appearance of liquidity.</p>
