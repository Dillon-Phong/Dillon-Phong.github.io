   <li>After Rackspace issued an <a href="https://twitter.com/Rackspace/status/1598761923008266240?s=20">update
         statement on Twitter</a> on Friday, that didn’t provide clients with any additional information. Users in the
      replies were quick to rip the company apart.<blockquote>
         <p>@Rare_Elements - <a href="https://twitter.com/Rare_Elements/status/1598762514820476928?s=20"><em>“This is a

      </blockquote>
   </li>
   <li>Four days after the Hosted Exchange service was brought down, <a
         href="https://twitter.com/Rackspace/status/1600126617040261120?s=20">Rackspace made another Twitter
         statement</a> revealing that the cause of the outage was due to a ransomware attack, something Twitter users
      already suspected on day 1 of the outage.</li>
   <li><a href="https://status.apps.rackspace.com/index/viewincidents?group=2">Rackspace posted an update on their
         website</a> announcing that they are in the early stages of an investigation led by a cyber defense firm and
      its own internal security team and at the moment <em>“it is too early to say what, if any, data was
         affected.”</em> and “<em>At this time, we are unable to provide a timeline for restoration of the Hosted
         Exchange environment.”</em> In other words, four days after the initial breach, they still have no idea if any
      data was encrypted, deleted, and/or exfiltrated; and they have no idea when the outage will be fixed.</li>
   <li>On the same day, Rackspace would give a press release claiming that <em>&quot;Based on the investigation to date,
         Rackspace Technology believes that this incident was isolated to its Hosted Exchange business&quot;</em>. </li>
   <li>The firm is working to migrate customers from its Hosted Exchange service to Microsoft 365, so that their

         an 8-K SEC filing</a>, Rackspace claims that it expects a loss of $30 million in annual revenue due to the
      ransomware attack impacting the business.<blockquote>
         <p><em>Although we are in the early stages of assessing this incident, the incident has caused and may continue
               to cause an interruption in our Hosted Exchange business and may result in a loss of revenue for the
               Hosted Exchange business, which generates approximately $30 million of annual revenue in our Apps &amp;
               Cross Platform segment. In addition, the Company may have incremental costs associated with its response
               to the incident.</em></p>

   <li>Rackspace is now being sued by a legal firm in California taking action on behalf of users.</li>
   <li><em>&quot;That Rackspace offered opaque updates for days, then admitted to a ransomware event without further

<p><em>Update - January 6, 2023</em></p>
<ul>
   <li>The hackers were able to intrude into Rackspace’s systems by leveraging a zero-day exploit titled <a

   <li>Hackers were able to gain access to the Personal Storage Tables of 27 customers out of a total of 30,000 on
      Rackspace’s Hosted Exchange email environment.</li>
   <li>Despite this, Rackspace claims that there is no evidence that customer’s emails or data from those personal
      storage folders were viewed, misused, or distributed by bad actors.</li>
   <li>Rackspace plans on retiring its Hosted Exchange platform in favor of migrating to Microsoft 365.</li>
   <li>It is not known whether Rackspace paid a ransom to the hackers or how much the ransom amount was.</li>
   <li>Rackspace has been working on recovering the email data stored on compromised servers. Over 50% has been

<h2 id="opinion-">Opinion:</h2>
From the response issued by Rackspace, it appears that they either do not have an Incident Response Team on site or that
they are not well versed in Cyber. Ransomware should be a pretty easy attack to notice and report when the perpetrators
literally leave a note asking for ransom. There is no reason why it should’ve taken four days, after suffering the
breach, for a vague update announcing that they have little to no info to share. The only thing I can remotely praise
Rackspace for is helping people migrate their inbox to Microsoft 365, a service not affected by the cyberattack. My
initial opinion of Rackspace was much more scathing, but since learning that the breach was a result of a zero-day
exploit, my stance has become much more benign. Rackspace did all they could to mitigate damage from the attack once it
was discovered. They powered down and disconnected the Hosted Exchange environment from the rest of their systems whilst
researching the cause of the issue, and they prioritized getting customers an alternative platform so that they could
resume business as soon as possible. Their fault comes in the fact that they did not properly inform customers of the
attack until the week after, causing clients to assume Rackspace had no plan to restore service and were operating
without leadership, resulting in panic, anger, and bad publicity on online forums and press. This goes to show that in
the wake of a cyberattack, public relations is just as important as technical response in mitigating harm to a company.
