<h1>Facts/Damages:</h1>

<ul>
   <li>After Rackspace issued an <a href="https://twitter.com/Rackspace/status/1598761923008266240?s=20">update
         statement on Twitter</a> on Friday, that didn’t provide clients with any additional information. Users in the
      replies were quick to rip the company apart.<blockquote>
         <p>@Rare_Elements - <a href="https://twitter.com/Rare_Elements/status/1598762514820476928?s=20"><em>“This is a
                  pathetic response @Rackspace. We are NOT patient, you are not posting regular updates…….and it’s
                  coming up on 14 hours of downtime. Don’t you have redundancy in place???”</em></a></p>
         <p>@JessicaJonap - <a href="https://twitter.com/JessicaJonap/status/1599610178017447937?s=20"><em>“Unbelievable
                  @rackspace. After 5 hours on hold, call was answered, we gave info politely, agent said to hold on a
                  moment, and we were disconnected. Poof. No help, wasted time.”</em></a></p>
      </blockquote>
   </li>
   <li>Four days after the Hosted Exchange service was brought down, <a
         href="https://twitter.com/Rackspace/status/1600126617040261120?s=20">Rackspace made another Twitter
         statement</a> revealing that the cause of the outage was due to a ransomware attack, something Twitter users
      already suspected on day 1 of the outage.</li>
   <li><a href="https://status.apps.rackspace.com/index/viewincidents?group=2">Rackspace posted an update on their
         website</a> announcing that they are in the early stages of an investigation led by a cyber defense firm and
      its own internal security team and at the moment <em>“it is too early to say what, if any, data was
         affected.”</em> and “<em>At this time, we are unable to provide a timeline for restoration of the Hosted
         Exchange environment.”</em> In other words, four days after the initial breach, they still have no idea if any
      data was encrypted, deleted, and/or exfiltrated; and they have no idea when the outage will be fixed.</li>
   <li>On the same day, Rackspace would give a press release claiming that <em>&quot;Based on the investigation to date,
         Rackspace Technology believes that this incident was isolated to its Hosted Exchange business&quot;</em>. </li>
   <li>The firm is working to migrate customers from its Hosted Exchange service to Microsoft 365, so that their
      customers can resume business as soon as possible.</li>

         an 8-K SEC filing</a>, Rackspace claims that it expects a loss of $30 million in annual revenue due to the
      ransomware attack impacting the business.<blockquote>
         <p><em>Although we are in the early stages of assessing this incident, the incident has caused and may continue
               to cause an interruption in our Hosted Exchange business and may result in a loss of revenue for the
               Hosted Exchange business, which generates approximately $30 million of annual revenue in our Apps &amp;
               Cross Platform segment. In addition, the Company may have incremental costs associated with its response
               to the incident.</em></p>
      </blockquote>
   </li>
   <li>Rackspace is now being sued by a legal firm in California taking action on behalf of users.</li>
   <li><em>&quot;That Rackspace offered opaque updates for days, then admitted to a ransomware event without further
         customer assistance is outrageous, [...] Despite hundreds of data breaches every year in this country, I am
         receiving reports of vulnerabilities in Rackspace&#39;s hosting environment that go back over a year. That, and
         a seeming lack of backup protocols is why a lawsuit like this is critical.&quot;</em> says Scott Cole, the
      principal attorney at Cole Van Note.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Update - January 6, 2023</em></p>
<ul>
   <li>The hackers were able to intrude into Rackspace’s systems by leveraging a zero-day exploit titled <a
         href="https://msrc.microsoft.com/update-guide/en-US/vulnerability/CVE-2022-41080">CVE-2022-41080</a>, which
      Microsoft labels as an “Exchange Server Elevation of Privilege Vulnerability”.</li>
   <li>Hackers were able to gain access to the Personal Storage Tables of 27 customers out of a total of 30,000 on
      Rackspace’s Hosted Exchange email environment.</li>
   <li>Despite this, Rackspace claims that there is no evidence that customer’s emails or data from those personal
      storage folders were viewed, misused, or distributed by bad actors.</li>
   <li>Rackspace plans on retiring its Hosted Exchange platform in favor of migrating to Microsoft 365.</li>
   <li>It is not known whether Rackspace paid a ransom to the hackers or how much the ransom amount was.</li>
   <li>Rackspace has been working on recovering the email data stored on compromised servers. Over 50% has been
      recovered as of January 6, 2023.</li>

<h1>Opinion:</h1>
From the response issued by Rackspace, it appears that they either do not have an Incident Response Team on site or that
they are not well versed in Cyber. Ransomware should be a pretty easy attack to notice and report when the perpetrators
literally leave a note asking for ransom. There is no reason why it should’ve taken four days, after suffering the
breach, for a vague update announcing that they have little to no info to share. The only thing I can remotely praise
Rackspace for is helping people migrate their inbox to Microsoft 365, a service not affected by the cyberattack. My
initial opinion of Rackspace was much more scathing, but since learning that the breach was a result of a zero-day
exploit, my stance has become much more benign. Rackspace did all they could to mitigate damage from the attack once it
was discovered. They powered down and disconnected the Hosted Exchange environment from the rest of their systems whilst
researching the cause of the issue, and they prioritized getting customers an alternative platform so that they could
resume business as soon as possible. Their fault comes in the fact that they did not properly inform customers of the
attack until the week after, causing clients to assume Rackspace had no plan to restore service and were operating
without leadership, resulting in panic, anger, and bad publicity on online forums and press. This goes to show that in
the wake of a cyberattack, public relations is just as important as technical response in mitigating harm to a company. -->

<h2 id="opinion-">Opinion:</h2>
<p>It was near impossible trying to find info regarding the specifics of the breach and malware. Almost all articles on
    the situation focus on the financial and business aspects, with minimal information on the cyber side. With the
    prevalence of shady business dealings and mismanagement going on at FTX, I personally believe the hack to be an
    inside job. Both FTX and FTX U.S. were breached simultaneously, just hours after they announced they were filing for
    bankruptcy. Such quick exfiltration means the hacker(s) had to have been in both FTX and FTX U.S.&#39;s systems
    before news of FTX&#39;s collapse even became mainstream or that they had a backdoor into the system. There&#39;s
    online speculation that Sam Bankman-Fried orchestrated the hack himself to try and take the money and run. It&#39;s
    clear why people believe this. Bankman-Fried&#39;s backdoor into FTX&#39;s financial spreadsheets is one of the most
    suspicious things I have ever seen in a company.</p>
<p>Furthermore, FTX and Alameda are two distinct legal entities owned by Sam Bankman-Fried, but with how closely they
    operate, they may as well be the same. Allegedly, both companies were managed by Bankman-Fried&#39;s inner circle of
    10 roommates. All of them either are or have been in romantic relationships with one another, with Sam
    Bankman-Fried, CEO of FTX, once dating Alameda&#39;s CEO, Caroline Ellison. Ellison also has a viral tweet stating
    <em>&#39;nothing like regular amphetamine use to make you appreciate how dumb a lot of normal, non-medicated human
        experience is&#39;</em> which led the New York Post to do some digging where they found a <a
        href="https://www.listennotes.com/podcasts/the-feedback-loop/sam-and-the-art-of-effective-DOU3SJaK2ZM/">podcast
        interview</a> with Bankman-Fried from October 2020, where he admitted to experimenting with Adderall and other
    amphetamines, which doesn&#39;t look good when people find out you secretly funneled $10 billion in client funds
    from one company to another, somehow losing $1 billion in the process, and then getting an additional half a billion
    dollars stolen. There will definitely be a lengthy legal investigation by U.S. officials into FTX&#39;s financial
    collapse and missing funds in the near future.</p>
