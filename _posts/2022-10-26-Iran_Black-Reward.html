<p>Black Reward is being incredibly smart, releasing the exfiltrated information in bits instead of all at once. Doing
    so applies a slow squeeze on the Iranian government, putting pressure on them to release the detained political
    prisoners and protesters. Whereas releasing the info all at once would be throwing the entirety of your bargaining
    chips away, all but resulting in the prisoners remaining detained.</p>
<p>Iran is also subject to the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). If any of the leaked info suggests that the
    country is developing a nuclear weapon, it would be a violation of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT), and
    the country would be subject to harsh sanctions from the U.N.</p>
