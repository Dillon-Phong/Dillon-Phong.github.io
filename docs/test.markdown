[Pro-Russian hackers claim responsibility for knocking U.S. airport websites offline](https://www.npr.org/2022/10/10/1127902795/airport-killnet-cyberattack-hacker-russia#:~:text=The%2520cyberattacks%2520claimed%2520by%2520Killnet,International%2520in%2520Atlanta%252C%2520among%2520others.)

## Victims:
- Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport (ATL),
- Los Angeles International Airport (LAX) 
- Chicago O'Hare International Airport (ORD), 
- Orlando International Airport (MCO),
- Denver International Airport (DIA),
- Phoenix Sky Harbor International Airport (PHX)
- +Other lesser airports

## Timeline:
- Date of attack: October 10, 2022 (Monday morning, Columbus Day)

## Facts/Damages:
- A large scale DDoS attack was launched against several major airports in the U.S.
- Airport websites became unavailable, either taken offline or response time slowed to a crawl.
- Other airports had returning database connection errors.
- Travelers couldn't get updates about their scheduled flights or book airport services. 
- Custom software was used to generate fake requests and garbage traffic directed at the targets in order to deplete resources for legitimate users.
- No flights directly impacted.

## Motive: 
- Political
    - Prompted due to the U.S.'s position in the Russia-Ukraine war.
    - Prompted due to the U.S.'s stance as the head of NATO.

## Attribution:
- KillNet (pro-Russian hacktivist group) 
    - The group released a [list of airports](https://www.bleepstatic.com/images/news/u/1220909/Forum%20and%20Marketplace%20Posts/airports.png) on Telegram, encouraging other members and volunteers to join in on the DDos attack against the airports.
    - KillNet has previously target other countries that sided with Ukraine, such as Romania and Italy.
    - KillNet's subgroup: Legion attacked Norweigan and Lithuanian entites for similar reasons.
    
## Opinion:
I looked online to see what days are the most common for flights to be booked, those days are Friday, Saturday, Sunday, and Monday; the day the attack took place. KillNet likely was gambling on a majority of the airline workers to be off on Monday in celebration of Columbus Day. This way maximizes the uptime of the DDos attack, since the fewer workers would take longer to resolve it.

If KillNet wanted to cause the most annoyance to civilians, they should've attacked between Friday afternoon and Saturday morning as that's when the most people would begin their flights to maximize their vacation time. Work week fatigue would also be setting in on the airline workers, slowing their work effort.
