[Hacktivists say they stole 100,000 emails from Iran's nuclear energy agency](https://www.theregister.com/2022/10/24/black_reward_iran_nuclear_leak/?&web_view=true)

## Victims:
- Iran's atomic energy organization + subsidiary that was breached

## Timeline:
- October 21, 2022 (Friday)

## Facts/Damages:
- A hacking group known as Black Reward hacked into an email server belonging to a subsidiary of Iran's atomic energy organization.
- Over 50GB of files from 324 inboxes containing 100,000 messages in total were exfiltrated.
- Black Reward warned that it would publish the stolen data within 24 hours unless the Islamic Republic releases all political prisoners and detained prisoners.
- The Iranian government refused, resulting in Black Reward releasing a trove of information including:
    - management and operational schedules of different parts of Bushehr power plant,
    - passports, visas, and payrolls of Iranian and Russian specialists working there,
    - atomic development contracts and agreements with domestic and foreign partners
    - [videos](https://twitter.com/IranIntl_En/status/1583862529679556610?s=20&t=0IcZ07RM77CJ9ydH7ihvlw) and documents related to Iran's nuclear program.
- The Iranian regime is downplaying the breach claiming that _"These illegal efforts out of desperation are aimed at attracting public attention"_.

## Motive: 
- Political
    - Black Reward released a [statement on Twitter](https://twitter.com/black_reward/status/1580967413910106117?s=20&t=XeqIONBDf4ne9vX_V5l8ug) announcing that their actions were an act of support for protesters in Iran.
    - _"Unlike Westerners, we do not flirt with criminal clerics, and if we promise something, we fulfill it 100%."_ 
    - _"In the name of Mahsa Amini and for women, life, freedom."_

## Attribution:
- Black Reward (Iranian hacking group)
    
## Opinion:
Black Reward is being incredibly smart, releasing the exfiltrated information in bits instead of all at once. Doing so applies a slow squeeze on the Iranian government, putting pressure on them to release the detained political prisoners and protesters. Whereas releasing the info all at once would be throwing the entirety of your bargaining chips away, all but resulting in the prisoners remaining detained.

Iran is also subject to the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). If any of the leaked info suggests that the country is developing a nuclear weapon, it would be a violation of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT), and the country would be subject to harsh sanctions from the U.N.
