    - Minutes later, Caroline Ellison, CEO of Alameda Research, tweets that Alameda will buy Zhao's FTT tokens for $22 each.

    - FTX assets get frozen by Bahamian regulators with a statement released saying, _"The commission is aware of public statements suggesting that clients' assets were mishandled, mismanaged and/or transferred to Alameda Research.

## Facts/Damages:

- FTX stated in its official Telegram channel that it had been compromised, instructing users not to install any new upgrades and to delete all FTX apps. _'FTX has been hacked. FTX apps are malware. Delete them. Chat is open. Don't go on FTX site as it might download Trojans'._
- Reports of people receiving SMS messages and emails being sent by FTX to customers telling them to log into the app and website, which were infected with a trojan.
- Simultaneous hacks against FTX and FTX U.S. indicate the possibility of an inside job.

- Alameda played a key role in FTX's meltdown - which began after CoinDesk reported that the hedge fund was heavily invested in FTT, a token issued by FTX. The disclosure prompted rival Binance to dump its FTT holdings and sparked a liquidity crunch that toppled FTX Group within days. ([Source: NYPost](https://nypost.com/2022/11/15/crypto-ceo-caroline-ellison-tweeted-about-regular-amphetamine-use/))
- Investigators at the S.E.C. and the Justice Department are examining whether Bankman-Fried improperly used customer funds to prop up Alameda Research, a trading firm that he also owns.
- FTX funneled $10 billion in client funds to Alameda to help bolster the firm's risky bets, and at least $1 billion of those funds is reportedly unaccounted for even amongst Alameda's assets.
- There was a backdoor into the accounting/book-keeping spreadsheets that allowed Sam Bankman-Fried to make changes to FTX's financials without alerting other systems.
- FTX has to pay over 1 million creditors, the theft of funds from the hack is compounding this difficulty.
- Customers of FTX could have to wait years to get their money back.

## Motive: 
- Financial
    - Between $400-600 million stolen

## Attribution:
- Currently unknown; however, Nick Percoco, Chief Security Officer at Kraken, tweeted that he knows the identity of the account holding onto the stolen assets, but can not share it due to the investigation.
- Speculated to be an insider.

## Opinion:
It was near impossible trying to find info regarding the specifics of the breach and malware. Almost all articles on the situation focus on the financial and business aspects, with minimal information on the cyber side. With the prevalence of shady business dealings and mismanagement going on at FTX, I personally believe the hack to be an inside job. Both FTX and FTX U.S. were breached simultaneously, just hours after they announced they were filing for bankruptcy. Such quick exfiltration means the hacker(s) had to have been in both FTX and FTX U.S.'s systems before news of FTX's collapse even became mainstream or that they had a backdoor into the system. There's online speculation that Sam Bankman-Fried orchestrated the hack himself to try and take the money and run. It's clear why people believe this. Bankman-Fried's backdoor into FTX's financial spreadsheets is one of the most suspicious things I have ever seen in a company.

Furthermore, FTX and Alameda are two distinct legal entities owned by Sam Bankman-Fried, but with how closely they operate, they may as well be the same. Allegedly, both companies were managed by Bankman-Fried's inner circle of 10 roommates. All of them either are or have been in romantic relationships with one another, with Sam Bankman-Fried, CEO of FTX, once dating Alameda's CEO, Caroline Ellison. Ellison also has a viral tweet stating _'nothing like regular amphetamine use to make you appreciate how dumb a lot of normal, non-medicated human experience is'_ which led the New York Post to do some digging where they found a [podcast interview](https://www.listennotes.com/podcasts/the-feedback-loop/sam-and-the-art-of-effective-DOU3SJaK2ZM/) with Bankman-Fried from October 2020, where he admitted to experimenting with Adderall and other amphetamines, which doesn't look good when people find out you secretly funneled $10 billion in client funds from one company to another, somehow losing $1 billion in the process, and then getting an additional half a billion dollars stolen. There will definitely be a lengthy legal investigation by U.S. officials into FTX's financial collapse and missing funds in the near future.

## Updates:
### November 11, 2022

[FTX's Bankman-Fried, Tom Brady and other celebrity promoters sued by crypto investors](https://www.reuters.com/legal/ftx-founder-bankman-fried-sued-us-court-over-yield-bearing-crypto-accounts-2022-11-16/)
